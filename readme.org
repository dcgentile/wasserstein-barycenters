This repository contains code which mostly serves as an exercise in using iterative methods to approximate Wasserstein barycenters and to consider the question of geodesic closure of a set of such barycenters for a fixed family of (centered Gaussian) measures.

gaussbarys.py contains the functions necessary for the computations, that is
- an implementation of the iterative scheme for approximating a Wasserstein barycenter as described in Alvarez-Esteban et al. (2016)
- an implementation of the scheme described in Werenski et al. (2022) for recovering barycentric coordinates of a target measure given a set of references
  rather than solving the quadratic program described in that paper, we instead search for eigenvectors with eigenvalue 0

currently main requires two command line arguments: the number of reference measures to generate, and the dimension of the matrices

example usage:

python3 main.py 2, 4

result of the example:
- generates 2 positive definite covariance matrices of size 4 x 4 and a random point in the simplex l0,
- computes nu = bar({mu_i}, l0)
- attempts to recover the barycentric coordinates l1 = coords({mu_i}, nu)
- computes the Frobenius norm of (nu - bar({mu_i}, l1))
